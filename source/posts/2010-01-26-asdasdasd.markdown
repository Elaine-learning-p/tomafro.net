A few days ago I wrote a post showing [how to use `File.expand_path` to generate paths relative to the current file](http://tomafro.net/2010/01/tip-relative-paths-with-file-expand-path).  Thanks to tweets from [Luke Redpath](https://twitter.com/lukeredpath/status/8216962316), [Ryan Bates](https://twitter.com/rbates/status/8225544463) and others, this post garnered a lot of attention.
