I'm a London based software developer, passionate about building and improving the web.  I work as a programmer for [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com).

Previously I was a member of [FreeRange](http://gofreerange.com), a small collective of talented, like-minded developers.  We worked on sites including [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/), [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk), [MUBI](https://mubi.com/), and many more.

You can see code I've written on github, mainly on [my account](https://github.com/tomafro), [FreeRange's account](https://github.com/freerange) or [Basecamp's](https://github.com/basecamp).
